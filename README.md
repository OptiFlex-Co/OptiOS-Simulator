# OptiOS UI | The OS made for YOU.

Hello! This is the official UI for OptiOS based on Capyloon's Nutria. 


# How to try a Simulator version it?

## Install neccesary packages.
First of all, you'll need a Rust toolchain for your Linux computer (Yes, this simulator only runs on Linux, but you can run it on Windows via WSL), you can install it from this website: https://rustup.rs/.

## Run the UI Simulator.
Open the folder of this simulator in a terminal and use these 2 commands to get the Simulator running:
1. `./jackady update-prebuilts`
2. `./jackady dev`


# A little bit about our UI.

The OptiOS UI looks a lot like the normal Nutria for now. In the future, the subject is about to change.
